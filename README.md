## Synopsis

This is code provided as-is from development of the FeatherFab prototype (www.featherfab.com). Our aim is to make it easy for anyone to design physical objects, and believe three-dimensional input in VR is a key breakthrough. The UI is provided here, with a custom data object output that needs to be parsed by a CAD engine. We used OpenSCAD and were in the process of moving to PythonOCC when we stopped development.

## Installation

Compiling FeatherFab requires Unreal Engine Editor 4.12.
